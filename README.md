# LeetCode
My solutions to exercises at https://leetcode.com.

These are my own implementations, everything should be running fast enough to pass through all tests and also be in the top execution (I try to optimize the memory usage, but my main ambition is speed). As I enjoy small and concise codes, whatever doesn't fit in this rule means that I've suffered xD
